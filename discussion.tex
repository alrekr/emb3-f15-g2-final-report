\section{Future work}
Outdoor video footage of an IRIS+ UAV showed that the LED's mounted below the arms are quite visible even in bright light. Thus it could be an idea to investigate if those diodes could be used for tracking the drone, enabling redundancy at longer distance. Taking it further, the marker could be made of a sheet of LED's. By making the marker shine red in itself it should be possible to see it even in bright light. The shape detector can not guide the UAV all the way down, so some sort of close-up guider has to be developed.

The size calculations should be fine tuned. Right now they do not appear to be accurate. 

The landing platform and system is still very much a prototype; battery interfacing is missing, the materials are not the final materials, and it looks unpolished. Additionally, some sort of weather screen, either a permeable tube with a lid on top, or just a lid. The weather screen should also be a thief deterrent somehow -- could be by hiding the platform through camouflage, or could be through heavy, sturdy materials.

The control loop for actual UAV control is missing and has to be developed.
